# Kickstart

My personal HTML/CSS/JS mini framework for quickly starting web projects.

## Features

- HTML5-ready.
- Common bug fixes and best practices included.
- Extensive inline documentation.
- Syntax highlighting with [Prism](http://prismjs.com/).
- The latest [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) via CDN, with a local fallback.
- [Single-direction margin declarations](http://csswizardry.com/2012/06/single-direction-margin-declarations/) for a nice and consistent vertical rythm.

## Inspired by

- [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
- [Formalize CSS](https://github.com/nathansmith/formalize)
